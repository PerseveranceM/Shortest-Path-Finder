# Shortest Path Finder

This is a C++ program that finds the shortest path between a start point 'S' and a goal point 'G' on a 2D grid. It implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths and determine the shortest one.

# Usage

1. Input the dimensions of the grid (rows and columns).
2. Input the grid configuration. Use 'S' to denote the start point, 'G' for the goal point, and 'x' for obstacles and the surrounding wall.
3. The program will output the grid with the shortest path marked by '\*'. If no path exists, it will print "No Path".
